   contains a lot of lines<br>
   and they are displayed.

</p>
Emphasis
Emphasis tags can be used to add emphasis to text.
<p>

<p>

</p>
Lists
You can add lists to your web pages. There are two types of lists in HTML.

Lists can be unordered using the <ul> tag. List items are specified using the <li> tag, for example:
<ul>
   <li>Tea</li>
   <li>Sugar</li>
   <li>Milk</li>
</ul>
<ol>
   <li>Rocky</li>
   <li>Rocky II</li>
   <li>Rocky III</li>
</ol>
Div tags
A <div> tag defines a content division in a HTML document. It acts as a generic container and has no effect on the content unless it is styled by CSS.

The following example shows a <div> element that contains a paragraph element:
<div>
   <p>This is a paragraph inside a div</p>
</div>
<style>
   div {
      border: 1px solid black;
      padding: 2px;
   }
</style>
<div>
   <div>
      <p>This is a paragraph inside stylized divs</p>
   </div>
</div>
